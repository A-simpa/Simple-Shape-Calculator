# Simple-Shape-Calculator

This is repository the first python project I did. 
The project is a development of a calculated that could calculate the area of a triangle, rectangle, circle, and square.
It has the capability to calculate the centroid of the plane shapes mentioned above
It can tell the name of a shape when the number of corners and side are given
I used two tools here which are Python an  PyQt.
This project is still opened for collaboration
